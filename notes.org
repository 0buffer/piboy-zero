TODO: check that silkscreen on imported boostcmponenet does not cover up the solder pads!

TODO: test software pwm (for tft backlight) and observer cpu usage

hand-solder module-on-module:
tin smd-pad; tin through-hole; put in place; solder toghether


*** LED backlight
from 2.2 spi tft (https://www.adafruit.com/products/1480)
Onboard 3.3V @ 150mA LDO regulator
4 white LED backlight, transistor connected so you can PWM dim the backlight
=> "lite" pin is in example unconnected = always on?

2.2" hat variant uses resistors on the kathode, and connects directly to +5V

the chinese knockoff board has all kathodes to gnd, and expects a regulated 3.4V (needs a regulator, since the leds will pull >100mA, more than a gpio can give)

board already in the fab - additional trace: bat-low -> ID_SD has to be wired per hand
