# Software Installation 

- Flash a micro SD card with the latest [RetroPie](https://retropie.org.uk/download/) (confirmed working with versions 3.6 to 4.1
- From the terminal on the Pi Zero (Or a Raspberry Pi 1 if you own it, since that's easier to connect to and the RetroPie image is the same):
    - sudo apt-get install subversion
    - wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JohSchneider/piboy-zero/master/software/setup_retropie.sh
    - sudo ./setup_retropie.sh
