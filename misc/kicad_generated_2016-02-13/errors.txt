* missing trace connecting powerboost:bat-low to the pi-zero
- additional trace: bat-low -> ID_SD

* wrong transistor pinout
- for Q3, was DGS instead of more common GSD
- turned out to be not needed and removed; single pulldown on enable pin and V_out from softpower works just fine

* clearance for protuding hdmi-connector tabs

* mounting holes undersized
- where 2.8mm instead of target 3mm -> increased to 3.1 (plating will take up space)

* rerouted usb
- for equal-lentgh traces, with kicads differential-pair routing tools
- and less vias/trace crossings

* wrong pinout on BJT transistor for backlight
- was BCE instead fof more common BEC

-> all errors adressed with board revision 2016-03-13
